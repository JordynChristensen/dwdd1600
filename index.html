            <h1>Learn about Barrel Racing</h1>

            <p> <strong> Barrel racing is a high-energy and thrilling rodeo event that showcases
                 the speed, agility, and precision of both horse and rider.<strong> This fast-paced 
                 competition has gained widespread popularity for its combination of skill, 
                 athleticism, and sheer excitement.</p>
             <h2>More information</h2>    
                 <p>The main objective of barrel racing is for 
                    the horse and rider to complete a cloverleaf pattern around three barrels set 
                    in a triangular formation as quickly as possible. The barrels are typically placed 
                    in a specific pattern, with the first and second barrels positioned on opposite ends 
                    of the arena and the third barrel placed in the middle. The rider starts from a designated 
                    point, usually marked by a timer, and races towards the first barrel, making a sharp turn 
                    around it before proceeding to the second barrel, then finally to the third. The sequence
                    of turns forms a cloverleaf pattern, and the rider must navigate it as efficiently as possible</p>
