            <p> <strong> Barrel racing is a high-energy and thrilling rodeo event that showcases
                 the speed, agility, and precision of both horse and rider.</strong> This fast-paced 
                 competition has gained widespread popularity for its combination of skill, 
                 athleticism, and sheer excitement.
            </p>

            <p>The main objective of barrel racing is for 
                    the horse and rider to complete a cloverleaf pattern around three barrels set 
                    in a triangular formation as quickly as possible. The barrels are typically placed 
                    in a specific pattern, with the first and second barrels positioned on opposite ends 
                    of the arena and the third barrel placed in the middle. The rider starts from a designated 
                    point, usually marked by a timer, and races towards the first barrel, making a sharp turn 
                    around it before proceeding to the second barrel, then finally to the third. The sequence
                    of turns forms a cloverleaf pattern, and the rider must navigate it as efficiently as possible

                Where did Barrel Racing come from?
            </h2>
            <p>
                The first barrel racing competition was intended for women only and was actually the first 
                equine sport women could compete in. <a href="Races.html#Races">The first official barrel racing began in 1928 in Stamford</a>,
                 Texas, and only consisted of two barrels. Horse and rider would run for the barrels, go right 
                 around the first, then left around another, and race back as fast as possible.The barrel racing we 
                 know today, consisting of three barrels, didn’t start until 1935. It was in this year that a third 
                 barrel was added. Though this was the year that modern barrel racing began, it wasn’t really judged 
                 professionally until 1949.It is thought that barrel racing became an official sport in 1948. It was 
                 first recognized as a sport in that year by the <em>WPRA (Women’s Professional Rodeo Association)</em> and
                  true timed and judged barrel racing competitions began the following year (1949).<a href="https://insiderhorse.com/what-is-barrel-racing/"
